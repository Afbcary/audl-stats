      I enjoyed reading Dan Fiorino's <a href="https://ultiworld.com/2019/03/29/predicting-audls-breakout-stars-stats/">article</a> but couldn't help feeling some of the
      same criticisms that he leveled against himself. Defense is equally as
      important as offense. Defensive players should be celebrated for their
      successes too. An all-encompassing stat should be very carefully tuned and
      weighted. Even then, there are intangables that people won't ever record
      on a stat-sheet. In the end the only thing that matters is that your team
      wins as many points as possible. Three caveats: 1. If those points aren't
      equally distributed among games, you can still lose games. 2. Your play in
      one point can affect how your team does in another point. 3. Some points
      are played against much stiffer competition than others. Lucky for me Dan made the data <a href="https://github.com/dfiorino/audl-pull">publically available</a>.

      To capture how effective teams and players are on offense and defense I
      calculated:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Offensive Efficiency = (Points Won on Offense) / (Points Played on
        Offense)
      </li>
      <li>
        Defensive Efficiency = (Points Won on Defense) / (Points Played on
        Defense)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div id="offenseWon"></div>
    <p>Here's how the teams ranked in 2018.</p>

      No suprise that the championship winning Radicals had stellar offense and
      defense on their championship run. It is suprising that the rush missed
      championship weekend entirely. In the west, the Cascades, Spiders, and
      Flamethrowers could only be carried so far by their offensive talent. The
      NY Empire, DC Breeze, and Growlers relied on their defense to break for
      the win.

    <p>In general, the more points a player tallied on offense, the poorer their play. On defense however, the team stalwarts performed better than the journeymen. This goes against the common sense that you must play a lot of offensive points to get chemistry with teammates and have a smooth flow. Also on defense I would have guessed the players who play most would get tired and less effective.</p>
    <p>It's easier to play good defense when you're emersed in a strong system led by a visionary coach and surrounded by experienced, bought-in teammates. On the fledgling teams in the AUDL, players must find their own way, and the stand-outs should be all the more celebrated. Compared to the team linear regression, the following players had positive error's of prediction.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Error of Prediction = (Actual Efficiency) - (Predicted efficiency of a player on their team who played as many points as they did)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Sample size is ever-important.</p>
