    <h1>The Ultimate Metric - 2018 AUDL</h1>
    <span>by Austin Cary</span>
    <p>
      I enjoyed reading Dan Fiorino's
      <a
        href="https://ultiworld.com/2019/03/29/predicting-audls-breakout-stars-stats/"
        >article</a

      but couldn't help feeling some of the same criticisms that he leveled
      against himself. Defense is equally as important as offense. Defensive
      players should be celebrated for their successes too. An all-encompassing
      stat should be very carefully tuned and weighted. Even then, there are
      intangables that people won't ever record on a stat-sheet. In the end the
      only thing that matters is that your team wins as many points as possible.
      Lucky for me Dan made the data
      <a href="https://github.com/dfiorino/audl-pull">publically available</a>.
      This analysis aims to highlight a different subset of players - the players
      that quietly do all the little things right and grind for every point.
      Two caveats: 
      <ol> 
      <li>Each point is played against a different opponent skill level.</li>
      <li>A player's performance in one point can affect the outcome of ensuing points.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      To capture how effective teams and players are on offense and defense I
      calculated:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Offensive Efficiency = (Points Won on Offense) / (Points Played on
        Offense)
      </li>
      <li>
        Defensive Efficiency = (Points Won on Defense) / (Points Played on
        Defense)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p id="offenseWon"></p>
    <div class="chart-container">
      <canvas id="teamOffensiveEfficiency"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p id="defenseWon"></p>
    <div class="chart-container">
      <canvas id="teamDefensiveEfficiency"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>
      No suprise that the Madison Radicals had stellar offense and
      defense on their championship run. It <em>is</em> suprising that the Toronto Rush missed
      championship weekend entirely. In the west, the Cascades, Spiders, and
      Flamethrowers could only be carried so far by their offensive talent. The
      NY Empire, DC Breeze, and Growlers relied on their defense to break for
      the win.

      In general, the more points a player tallied on offense, the poorer their
      play. On defense however, the team stalwarts performed better than the
      journeymen. This goes against the common sense that you must play a lot of
      offensive points to get chemistry with teammates and have a smooth flow.
      Also on defense I would have guessed the players who play most would get
      tired and less effective.</p>
    <p>Teams with large positive slopes for their offensive / defensive linear regressions would likely benefit from playing their stars even more frequently. Those with negative slopes might advance by giving less-known players additional touches.</p>
    <p>
      It's easier to play good defense when you're emersed in a strong system
      led by a visionary coach and surrounded by experienced, bought-in
      teammates. On the fledgling teams in the AUDL, players must find their own
      way, and the stand-outs should be all the more celebrated. Compared to the
      team linear regression, the following players had positive error's of
      prediction.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Error of Prediction = (Actual Efficiency) - (Predicted efficiency of a
        player on their team who played as many points as they did)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Sample size is key.</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading! I welcome feedback at <a href="mailto:afbcary@gmail.com">afbcary@gmail.com</a>. The code that generated this article is open source at <a href="https://github.com/afbcary/audl-stats">https://github.com/afbcary/audl-stats</a>. Help me find a better stat than error of prediction for the last two graphs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%27s_distance">Cook's distance</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(statistics)">leverage</a>?).  </p>
